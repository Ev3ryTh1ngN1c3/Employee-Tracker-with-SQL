  ## Project Motivation

  for business owners <br>
  to be able to view & manage departments, roles & employees in the company <br>
  this project helps organize & plan a business <br>

  ## What Was Learned

  In this project I learned how to create a command-line application that allows users to manage employee information using a MySQL database. This project focuses on various SQL concepts & techniques, including creating & modifying tables, performing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), using joins to retrieve data from multiple tables & implementing basic command-line user interfaces. The project also covers topics such as database schema design, data validation & error handling.
